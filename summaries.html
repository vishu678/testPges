Relative humidity should be maintained at a level between 30% and 60%. Lower humidity may discourage pests, mold, and bacterial growth, while higher humidity encourages virus particles to decay faster, potentially reducing the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The report also highlights two gases of concern: Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2). CO is an odorless, colorless gas produced by incomplete fuel burning that can cause symptoms such as fatigue, chest pain, headaches, dizziness, confusion, nausea, flu-like symptoms, and even be fatal at high concentrations. On the other hand, CO2 is a natural component of exhaled breath but also results from fossil fuel burning. High levels of CO2 can cause headache, dizziness, nausea, and even asphyxiation at extremely high concentrations.</p>
<p>Airborne particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) caused by wildfire smoke and vehicle exhaust is another concern. These tiny particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and affect both the heart and lungs. Children, older adults, and people with heart or lung diseases are at greater risk from PM exposure.</p>
<p>Lastly, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) found in many household products can off-gas into indoor air. These chemicals, which may not be easily detectable by smell, can pose health risks when inhaled over extended periods. Common examples of VOCs include benzene, formaldehyde, and toluene.</p>
<p>To address these issues, the report encourages taking proactive measures such as improving ventilation, maintaining appropriate temperature and humidity levels, ensuring proper HVAC systems, minimizing CO emissions, managing CO2 concentrations, reducing particulate matter exposure, and avoiding excessive use of products containing VOCs. The IAQ program offers assistance in identifying sources, potential remedies, and providing referrals to professional HVAC resources.</p>
